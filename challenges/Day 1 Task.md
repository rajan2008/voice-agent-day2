# Day 1 – Get Your Starter Voice Agent Running

For Day 1, your objective is to:

- **Get this starter repo running end-to-end** (backend + frontend) by following the setup and run instructions in `README.md`.
- **Successfully connect to the voice agent** in your browser and have a brief conversation.
- **Record a short video** of your session with the agent and **post it on LinkedIn** with a description of what you did for Day 1 and a mention of the “10 Days of Voice Agents” challenge.

Once your agent is running and your LinkedIn post is live, you’ve completed Day 1.
